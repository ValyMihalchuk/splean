/-* *** Tactic [xchange] -/

/-* [xchange] performs rewriting on the LHS of an entailment.
  Essentially, it applies to a goal of the form [H1 \as  H2 ==> H3],
  and exploits an entailment [H1 ==> H1'] to replace the goal with
  [H1' \* H2 ==> H3].

  The tactic is actually a bit more flexible in two respects:
  - it does not force the LHS to be exactly of the form [H1 \* H2]
  - it takes as argument any lemma, whose instantiation result in
    a heap entailment of the form [H1 ==> H1'].

  Concretely, the tactic is just a wrapper around an application
  of the lemma called [xchange_lemma], which appears below.

  [xchanges] combines a call to [xchange] with calls to [xsimpl]
  on the subgoals. -/
